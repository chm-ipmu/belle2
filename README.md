###### DPhil Candidate, University of Oxford

The first two years of my PhD ("DPhil" in Oxford terms) were spend working on LHCb
at the University of Oxford. 

The last two years, beginning October 2019, will be spent working on Belle II at
the Kavli Institute for the Physics and Mathematics of the Universe (IPMU).

Please see the b2jpsi_eta folder for more details on my current analysis project.
Having been giving a fresh start at an analysis I aim to make this as reproducible as 
possible, and to employ best practises wherever possible.
